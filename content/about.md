type: about

Sqitch is a database change management application. What makes it different from
your typical migration-style approaches? A few things:

{{% section class="db" %}}

No Opinions
-----------

Sqitch is not tied to any framework, ORM, or platform. Rather, it is a
standalone change management system with no opinions about your database engine,
application framework, or development environment.

Native scripting
----------------

Changes are implemented as scripts native to your selected database engine.
Writing a [PostgreSQL] application? Write SQL scripts for `psql`. Writing a
[MySQL]-backed app? Write SQL scripts for `mysql`.

Dependency resolution
---------------------

Database changes may declare dependencies on other changes --- even changes from
other Sqitch projects. This ensures proper order of execution, even when you've
committed changes to your VCS out-of-order.

Deployment integrity
--------------------

Sqitch manages changes and dependencies via a plan file, employing a [Merkle
tree] pattern similar to [Git] and [Blockchain] to ensure deployment integrity.
As such, there is no need to number your changes, although you can if you want.
Sqitch doesn't much care how you name your changes.

Iterative development
---------------------

Up until you [tag](/docs/manual/sqitch-tag/) and [release] your application, you
can modify your change deployment scripts as often as you like. They're not
locked in just because they've been committed to your VCS. This allows you to
take an iterative or test-driven approach to developing your database schema.
