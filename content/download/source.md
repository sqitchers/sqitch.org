The canonical source for Sqitch releases is [CPAN]. Use the cpan or [cpanminus]
client to download and build Sqitch and its dependencies from source, as well as
the appropriate database drivers. For example, to install Sqitch with [PostgreSQL]
and [SQLite] support:

    cpan install App::Sqitch DBD::Pg DBD::SQLite

The database drivers for each engine are:

*   PostgreSQL, YugabyteDB, and CockroachDB: `DBD::Pg`
*   SQLite: `DBD::SQLite`
*   Oracle: `DBD::Oracle`
*   MySQL: `DBD::mysql`
*   Firebird: `DBD::Firebird`
*   Vertica, Exasol, Snowflake: `DBD::ODBC`

Download the source from [GitHub] or [CPAN]. Or clone the latest version:
